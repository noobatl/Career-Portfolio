## DESCRIPTION
 
As a novice full stack developer, I want to showcase my accomplishments by creating a professional portfolio page. 
My personal portfolio page was created to cumulate the projects I have created since starting my full stack career. 
As another member of a growing industry, I want to have a webpage that will hold my career resume and project in one place. 
This will show prospect employers what my capabilities are when using my full stack skills. 
My project will help me stand out from other developers in that it will keep updating with the most recent projects.
